## Demo of gradient descent and regularization

Run `python linreg_sgd_regularized.py` to generate new plots.

Try changing the following arguments:
  `--lp`: either 1 for L1 or 2 for L2
  `--alpha`: how much regularization?
  `--lr`: what's the learning rate?
  `--num_steps`: how many steps of SGD to take -- one png per step
